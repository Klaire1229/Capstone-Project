Business Problem Section\n##### Introduction\n\nKyoto, once the capital of Japan, is in the Kansai region on the island of Honshu. Kyoto forms a part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kobe. Millions of travelers visit Kyoto each year to explore the city's cultural and historical attractions, such as: numerous classical Buddhist temples, Japanese style gardens, imperial palaces, Shinto shrines, traditional wooden houses and so on. There are a lot of travel agencies that offer various deals on flights, hotel stays and landmark tickets. Also, there are people who prefer not to work with a travel agency and want to plan the holiday on their own.\n\nIf someone wants to travel, there are many things to consider from choosing the right location, accommodation, flights, rental cars to attractions, restaurants, stores and other facilities. Therefore, the main idea is that in both cases, on their own and with a travel agency, it is necessary to have a list of recommendations and criteria of choosing the optimal one. So it will be better to develop one application that incorporate a lot of machine learning techniques and leverage the Foursquare location data in order to cluster different cities neighborhoods. And I choose Kyoto to recommend venues and to support people who are looking for the best hotel before travelling.\n\n##### Business Problem\nIn this scenario, the business problem I am trying to solve is: How could I provide support to different stakeholders (visitors or tourism agencies) in choosing the best accommodation? Which place is the best for them to stay?\nTo solve this business problem, I will use Foursquare location data and create machine learning models to cluster Kyoto and nearby areas neighborhoods in order to recommend profitable hotels based on different surrounding facilities such as restaurants, stores, attractions, transportations and so on. Through these methods the stakeholders will have a wide range of recommendations for accommodation. They will have lots of options and find the most suitbale one based on all the facilities close to hotels.\n\n### 2. Data Section\nTo perform this idea, I utilized data from 2 different sources: \n\n1, Data about hotels of Kyoto and nearby areas was taken from: https://www.booking.com. I collected information about postal code, name, address of hotels. Then I integrated data into a database which contains 40 observations of 40 hotels from Kyoto and nearby areas. For a better analysis, I selected data of hotels from different areas and with different facilities.\n\n2, Another source I used to explore and target recommended hotels across different venues is Foursquare location data. I imported it into a pandas dataframe for data exploration, visualization and modeling.\n\nThe final database will have a combination of Foursquare location data and Kyoto nearby areas hotels data. It will be used to develop the machine learning models and to cluster Kyoto nearby areas neighborhoods with the aim to provide the best recommendations in choosing a hotel.\n\n### 3. Methodology Section\n\nIn this part, I will present 3 main components of the report:\n\n1, Data Collection: load all the required information into one single data frame \n\n2, Data Exploration and Understanding: inspect data, extract and analyze all the hidden insights of Data Modeling\n\n3, K-means Clustering: cluster Kyoto and nearby hotels to see how they group together and reach the final purpose to provide useful accommodation strategies\n\n### 4.
