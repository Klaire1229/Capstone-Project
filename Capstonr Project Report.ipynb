Business Problem Section\n##### Introduction\n\nKyoto, once the capital of Japan, is in the Kansai region on the island of Honshu. Kyoto forms a part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kobe. Millions of travelers visit Kyoto each year to explore the city's cultural and historical attractions, such as: numerous classical Buddhist temples, Japanese style gardens, imperial palaces, Shinto shrines, traditional wooden houses and so on. There are a lot of travel agencies that offer various deals on flights, hotel stays and landmark tickets. Also, there are people who prefer not to work with a travel agency and want to plan the holiday on their own.\n\nIf someone wants to travel, there are many things to consider about choosing the right location, accommodation, flights, rental cars to attractions, restaurants, stores and other facilities. Therefore, the main idea is that in both cases, on their own and with a travel agency, it is necessary to have a list of recommendations and criteria of choosing the optimal one. So it will be better to develop one application that incorporate a lot of machine learning techniques and leverage the Foursquare location data in order to cluster different cities neighborhoods. And I choose Kyoto to recommend venues and to support people who are looking for the best hotel before travelling.\n\n##### Business Problem\nIn this scenario, the business problem I am trying to solve is: How could I provide support to different stakeholders (visitors or tourism agencies) in choosing the best accommodation? Which place is the best for them to stay?\nTo solve this business problem, I will use Foursquare location data and create machine learning models to cluster Kyoto and nearby areas neighborhoods in order to recommend profitable hotels based on different surrounding facilities such as restaurants, stores, attractions, transportations and so on. Through these methods the stakeholders will have a wide range of recommendations for accommodation. They will have lots of options and find the most suitbale one based on all the facilities close to hotels.\n\n### 2. Data Section\nTo perform this idea, I utilized data from 2 different sources: \n\n1, Data about hotels of Kyoto and nearby areas was taken from: https://www.booking.com. I collected information about postal code, name, address of hotels. Then I integrated data into a database which contains 40 observations of 40 hotels from Kyoto and nearby areas. For a better analysis, I selected data of hotels from different areas and with different facilities.\n\n2, Another source I used to explore and target recommended hotels across different venues is Foursquare location data. I imported it into a pandas dataframe for data exploration, visualization and modeling.\n\nThe final database will have a combination of Foursquare location data and Kyoto nearby areas hotels data. It will be used to develop the machine learning models and to cluster Kyoto nearby areas neighborhoods with the aim to provide the best recommendations in choosing a hotel.\n\n### 3. Methodology Section\n\nIn this part, I will present 3 main components of the report:\n\n1, Data Collection: load all the required information into one single data frame \n\n2, Data Understanding and Exploration: inspect data, extract and analyze all the hidden insights of Data Modeling\n\n3, K-means Clustering: cluster Kyoto and nearby hotels to see how they group together and reach the final purpose to provide useful accommodation strategies\n\n### 4. Results Section\nThe map of Kyoto and nearby areas shows based on postal code(known latitude and longitude values) and address of all the collected hotels. For a better analysis, nearby hotels with different surrounding facilities included.\n\n1, The results present number of venues for each hotel. Hotels that close to center of ward and tourist attractions have the most facilities (e.g. Hotel Gran Ms Kyoto, Hotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo, The Thousand Kyoto, PARK HYATT KYOTO ), compared to the hotels located further from center of ward and tourist attractions (e.g. Kiraku Kyoto Aneyakoji, Grand Prince Hotel Kyoto, Imu Hotel Kyoto). \n\n2, It also shows available venues close to each hotel. There are wide range of restaurants (Yoshoku, American, Chinese, Donburi, Dim Sum.etc), Art museum, Antique Shop, Beer bar, Camera store, Flower shop, Ice Cream Shop, grocery stores, Train station and so on. \n\n3, We can find the top 5 most common venues for each hotel. Hotels from central areas have particular facilities, such as: local and foreign restaurants, cafe, bar, bakery, grocery stores along with tourist attractions: Nineizaka (Ninenzaka), H\u014dkan-ji Temple, The Museum of Kyoto, Higashiyama Jisho-ji, Heian Shrine and so on.\n\n4, The map and the last 7 tables show the cluster grouping mode. The clusters were grouped by similarities. It can be noticed that hotels with common venues and many tourism attractions are grouped together, compared to hotels located in less crowded areas and with fewer facilities and tourism attractions. The largest cluster, which is the first one, contains the most number of hotels. They have the largest number of facilities and benefits from tourist attractions. These are also the most expensive ones. The price of accommodation differs depending on the facilities and surroundings. And the closer the hotel is to the tourist attractions, the more expensive it will be.\n\n### 5. Discussion Section\nIt will be lots of hotel choices when you are planning to visit Kyoto. The cost of accommodation varies according to its region and type. While hotels are inevitably more expensive in Kyoto, there are also many hotels nearby Kyoto.\n\nIt is notable that, although the hotels in the center of ward (e.g. Hotel Gran Ms Kyoto, Hotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo, The Thousand Kyoto, PARK HYATT KYOTO) are considered very expensive due to surrounding facilities, such as restaurants (Yoshoku, American, Chinese, Donburi, Dim Sum.etc), Art museum, Antique Shop, Beer bar, Camera store, Flower shop, Ice Cream Shop, grocery stores, Train station and so on. Hotels nearby the center also have a wide range of facilities and tourist attractions: Kiraku Kyoto Aneyakoji, Grand Prince Hotel Kyoto, Imu Hotel Kyoto.\n\nAlthough, all the clusters have an optimal range of facilities, I find two main patterns. The first pattern: clusters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, highlights hotels that have a smaller number of facilities and located in less crowded areas. Instead, the second pattern, cluster 1, highlights hotels that have the most of facilities and tourist attractions.\n\n\n### 6. Conclusion Section\nTo solve this business problem, I clustered hotels from Kyoto and nearby areas in order to recommend venues and to support people looking for the right hotel to make the best decisions.\n\nI gathered data from https://www.booking.com and Forsquare tool. I explored and targeted specific locations across different venues. Then, I extracted, analyzed and discovered hidden insigths of datasets and finally utilized k-means clustering technique to cluster Kyoto and nearby hotels to see how they group togheter with the final puurpose to provide useful information related to accomodation strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, Kyoto is one of the most popular destinations in Japan. It offers a wide range of tourist attractions: culture, nature, history, art and so on. If someone wants to travel, there are many things to consider about choosing the right location, accommodation, flights, rental cars to attractions, restaurants, stores and other facilities. The price of accommodation depends on the number of venues and surroundings. The closer hotel is to the tourist attractions, the more expensive it will be. It's notable that there are also good and less expensive hotels at a quite short distance from the center, so it is not necessarily mandatory to stay in the center to visit tourism attractions.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
